# 📊 Python Population Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a Python practical assignment to demonstrate core data analytics skills using a global population dataset. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and visualisation to extract meaningful insights from raw data.

The project showcases the use of Python for structured analytical problem-solving and clear presentation of results.

## Project Objectives
The script answers five analytical questions related to global population trends:

1. Countries with zero population in 2000  
2. Total African population in 2010  
3. Average population of South America in 2000  
4. Countries exceeding 100 million population in 2007  
5. European population growth between 2000 and 2010  

Each question involves data filtering, aggregation, and graphical representation of results.
